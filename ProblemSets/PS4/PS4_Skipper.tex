\section{Question: 5.D}
The object of mydf is list 
The object of mydf(moneysign)players is a data.frame

\section{Question: 6.5.B}
What happened: unable to find an inherited method for function ‘select’ for signature ‘"data.frame", "NULL"’

Happened because some functions in R can not be applied to sparkR. So, to get a data frame to work in sparkR, one needs to convert the data frame into a sparkR data frame with createDataFrame(...)

\section{Question: 6.6.B}
What happened: unable to find an inherited method for function ‘filter’ for signature ‘"data.frame", "logical"’

Happened because of the same issue above a logical issue happened instead of NULL

\section{Question: 7}
Some data sources that I would be interested in scraping from would be economic data from quantmod or quandl. I'm leaning towards doing a topic over education or sports. One topic I have in mind for education, is deciding whether certain economic factors, I do not know which ones yet, impact a county's education rank. As for sports, maybe finding out if players are being overpaid or underpaid for their performance. Looking at professional basketball or football player salaries and stats from ESPN.
